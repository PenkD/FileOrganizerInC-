# File Organizer
> [!NOTE]
> Download the EXE and run
> Enter a valid directory


Issue #1 
Q: 
> [!WARNING]
> "I put "Downloads" as my directory and it says its invalid"
> Enter C:\users\(name)\Downloads **do not use abbreviations**




> [!TIP]
>Build it with my code with [Visual Studio Console APP](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) if you're not comfortable running the EXE or just use the [python script](https://github.com/PenkD/FileOrganizer) (you can view the code easily).
