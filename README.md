>added shortcuts, you can now use downloads, desktop, documents, pictures, music, and videos instead of typing the entire location




> [!TIP]
>Build it with my code in [Visual Studio Console APP](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) if you're not comfortable running the EXE or just use the [python script](https://github.com/PenkD/FileOrganizer) (you can view the code easily).
